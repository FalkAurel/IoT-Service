# IoT Service in Rust 🌐🛠️

Welcome to the IoT Service in Rust! 🚀 This project showcases a seamless integration between an ESP32 device, a Rust server, and a Python application, enabling real-time data collection and visualization. 📊

## Project Overview

- **ESP32 Device**: Collects sensor data and transmits it over Wi-Fi.
- **Rust Server**: Receives data from the ESP32 and forwards it to the Python application.
- **Python Application**: Visualizes the data in real time using `matplotlib`.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Efficiently gathers data from sensors connected to the ESP32.
- **Seamless Data Transmission**: Utilizes the Rust server to handle data exchange between the ESP32 and the Python application.
- **Dynamic Data Visualization**: Employs `matplotlib` in Python to plot data as it's received.
